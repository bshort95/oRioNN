## The Project
Using machine learning RNN to generate fake review scores and text for testing purposes.

## Name
oRioNN Name Generator

## Description
In this years hackathon we were given a mission to create a program which generates dummy data for future software testing. 

## Getting started  
Download the application folder, and run the mastermind.py file. after which you will be prompted to input how many positive or negative comments you want generated  
after the program runs a csv will be generate in the output folder  
  
## Contents
There are two folders in this repository.
The data folder contains all the data we are using to generate the contents of the csv.  
including :  
Name Data
Company Data
Positive Comments and
Negitive Comments

The positive and negitive comments are generated by a rnn which was trained a dataset for hotel service reviews with some editing to make the generated text  
fit more closely with the originald

The other folder we have is the com_gen or comment generation folder
In this we have two ipynb files which have the creation of two rnns,  
One for generating positive comments
The other for generating negitive comments
We also have a zip of the model itself if you would like to generate
